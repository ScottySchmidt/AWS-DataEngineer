    "# AWS Data Engineer Pipeline\n",
    "The following data engineer system automatically ingests data, stores and processes it, and produces analytics outputs, all deployed through Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK in Python). The architecture follows a four-part pattern: ingest → store → analyze → deploy. This project is adapted from a top industry data-engineering interview \"internship\" challenge. \n",

    "## Project Summary\n",
    "This pipeline pulls data from public APIs, stores it in Amazon S3, processes it with AWS Lambda, and produces outputs suitable for analytics and reporting. All components, including compute, storage, permissions, and scheduling, are provisioned automatically using the AWS CDK in Python.\n",

    "#### Part 1: AWS S3 & Sourcing Datasets\n",
    "1. Republish [this open dataset](https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/pr/) in Amazon S3 and share with us a link.\n",
    "    - You may run into 403 Forbidden errors as you test accessing this data. There is a way to comply with the BLS data access policies and re-gain access to fetch this data programatically. The BLS data access policies can be found here: https://www.bls.gov/bls/pss.htm . BLS also reserves the right to block robots that do not contain information that can be used to contact the owner. Blocking may occur in real time. An API key and  Adding a <code>User-Agent</code> header to your request with contact information will comply with the BLS data policies and allow you to keep accessing their data programmatically. \n",
    "2. Script this process so the files in the S3 bucket are kept in sync with the source when data on the website is updated, added, or deleted.\n",
    "    - Don't rely on hard coded names - the script should be able to handle added or removed files.\n",
    "    - Ensure the script doesn't upload the same file more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: APIs\n",
    "1. Create a script that will fetch data from [this API](https://honolulu-api.datausa.io/tesseract/data.jsonrecords?cube=acs_yg_total_population_1&drilldowns=Year%2CNation&locale=en&measures=Population).\n",
    "   You can read the documentation [here](https://datausa.io/about/api/).\n",
    "2. Save the result of this API call as a JSON file in S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Data Analytics\n",
    "0. Load both the csv file from **Part 1** `pr.data.0.Current` and the json file from **Part 2**\n",
